    "If I wanted to publish the data visualizations I create, I need to be mindful of people having [**colour blindness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness). Thankfully, there are colour palettes I can use that are friendly for people with colour blindness. One of them is called [Color Blind 10](http://tableaufriction.blogspot.com/2012/11/finally-you-can-use-tableau-data-colors.html) and was released by Tableau, the company that makes the data visualization platform of the same name.\n",

    "Data-ink is the non-erasable ink used for the presentation of data. If data-ink would be removed from the image, the graphic would lose the content. Non-Data-Ink is accordingly the ink that does not transport the information but is used for scales, labels and edges. The data-ink ratio is the proportion of Ink that is used to present actual data compared to the total amount of ink (or pixels) used in the entire display. \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-data ink includes any elements in the chart that don't directly display data points. This includes tick markers, tick labels, and legends. Data ink includes any elements that display and depending on the data points underlying the chart. In a line chart, the data-ink would primarily be the lines and in a scatter plot, the data-ink would primarily be in the markers. As I increase the data-ink ratio, I decrease non-data ink that can help a viewer understand certain aspects of the plots. I need to be mindful of this trade-off as I work on making the appearance of plots to tell a story because plots I create could end up telling the wrong story.\n",

    "This principle was originally set forth by [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte), a pioneer in the field of data visualization. Tufte's first book, **The Visual Display of Quantitative Information**, is considered a bible among information designers.\n",
